Hi @Mike Murg - caught up with the team at Beverage Gurus today. great catch up, a couple of points below;
Stressed the need for confidentiality on this project, they are fully committed, but lets include this as an item to chat through tomorrow whether there is further protection that can be talked through.
We need to make a call on Ascorbic Acid vs. non ascorbic acid. When they say ascorbic acid is performing better, what they mean is that it is browning less, smell aroma is being retained for longer & as we found out today, there is less flavour degradation.
Blending tomorrow down in TA - I will send some images and then we can make the call re confidence in confidentiality.
I will send the 12 samples I tried today up to you to also try.
Need to think about the label - please store chilled - may need to be a consideration.
Chat tomorrow.
